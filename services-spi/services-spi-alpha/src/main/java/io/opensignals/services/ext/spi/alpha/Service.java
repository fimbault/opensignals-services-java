/**
 * The SPI implementation of {@link Services.Service}.
 * <p>
 * Implementation Note:
 * Currently the scoring of a signal involves first mapping it to
 * a status and then scoring the status. We could in the future
 * allow for the mapping of signal to status to be configurable as
 * well as the scoring to be done on the signal itself.
